git --> we can work in local
github-->we can work only online

create a repository 
Once createa repository , then create file.
For creating a file two ways 
    a) create a new file
    b) upload a file
Once created file then we can committed ur changes.
Incase if u need to do any changes in file , u can do only in local . Because in online there is no any scope.
we have a download scope right.

go to local (git or cloud machine or laptop) 
here we can modfiied file after that clone to online.

once u cloned to online to local , then form insdie online whatever files , it will come automatically in local also.
inside local we can do our changes and committed.

git commit -m
