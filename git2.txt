Introduction : 
====================
SDLC : Software development life cycle 
  Planning : Used jira , planning to work. requirement analysys
  Defining : which technlogy need to decide ,  will start desiginig (Development)
  What is continous integration ?
  Ans) Whenever multiple developers working whoever work source code in repository. then everyone will work independenenlty wihtout 
       any conflicts.
	 CD ->soon as developers commit code ,then automatically it will be committed, tested,build and deployed.
	 
   we can maintain the code through source code management tools.
   
   Now our programs all worked correctly.Now project is ready.
   we can't give code directly to customer right.
   It's has to be in the compreshed format Or executable format orfile . this is called Building.
   By using Build tool we can get it .
   
   Source code mgmt -> git and git hub
   Build tool --> maven
   
   1) if you are using java application , then u have to use the Build tool like "Ant", "Maven", "Gradle".
   2) whenever you build java project what u will get ?
       Ans) we will get jar (java archieve) files -it is a collection of .class files (
	                    war (Web archieve) files - web related files (HTML, CSS, java scrpits)
                        Ear ( enterprise) file s- it's collection of both jar and war.
						
        Dotnet --> we can use Ms file .MSI,.exi.
		
	how to check maven version?
	$mvn --version or mvn -n
	
	how to install Maven?
	Use yum and 
	    wget ( need to download first ) after install.
		
   $yum install maven
   $mvn --version (developed by apache)
   path : usr/share/home
   
   Jvaa : 17.0.14
   
   or 
   wget maven $cd /opt
    $eget URL ( installed)
	save tar file
  
  We need to untar file 
   $tar -xvzff tarfile.
   
   
Whats is Maven?
Ans) It is Build tool in java projects and not only build tool .it's a project comprehension tool.
     Which means it will give one project structure for your projetc . which will be very usefull for developers and testers.
	 
	 
 Install Maven ?
 -----------------
    1) check maven installed or not ?
	   $Mvn -v or mvn --version
	2) go to root : sudo sudo
	3) Download the maven : Wget URL
	4) Need to unzip the file(tar file) : tar -xvzf filename
	need to set environment varialbles
	 $ export MAVEN_HOME=repo/apache-3.9.9.
	 $ export PATH=$MAVEN_HOME/bin:$PATH (bin:$PATH- it will store environment variables)
	 $ source ~/.bashrc
	 
MVN Lifcycels : Dafult 
                Clean
			    Site 
		Consiste of build pahses: 
		  1) valdiate : Validate the project structure  ( corrct informatio and Pom,xml ) 
		  2) compile : it will compile the source code of the project.
		  3) test  : it will run the unit test cases (Junit testing) 
		  4) package : compile code , it will convert into the distributed format.
		  6) verfiy : run's any verification process ( integration testing) 
		  7) install:it will install the packaged artifacts ( build and executable files) 
		  8) Deploy : it will deploy the packaged artifacts  remote repository.
		  
  Clean: 1) pre_clean : it will execute the task before the cleaning
	     2) clean - clean the project ( target -->one direcory create automatically deleted) 
		 3) post_clean : once cleaned after you can perform any tasks.
		 
		 
-->Cretae project in maven?
   $ mvn archetype:generate -DgroupId=com.example \
     -DartifactId=my-app \
	 -DarchetypeArtfactId-maven-archtype-quickstart \
	 -DinteractiveMode=false
	 
$mvn archetype:generate -DgroupId=google.com \
     -DartifactId=my-mvn
	 -DarchetypeArtfactId-maven-archtype-quickstart \
	 -DinteractiveMode=false
	
	Enter , It will downloading central repository
	
 Note :  Whenever we are creating maven project , we need to know 3 thinhs
        -->groupid (project id)
		-->ArchifactId -project name
		-->Version 
		

		
  How to create maven project?
   $mvn architype:generate
   
  how to work maven?
  maven have one central repository. from web can download , what they need plugins download and what parameters passed.
  
  Once we run these command , it will scan in local .wheather is there or not in local . if not there then chekcing .
  Downloading from central repository(https://repo.maven.apache.org)
  .pom 
  .jar
  
  Basically maven mostly depends on pom (project object model) 
  
  $ ls -lrt ( check project created or not) 
     create my-app
	 
  $ cd my-app
    Pom.xl (without pom we can't work in maven)
	
  how to see project structure ?
  $ tree src
  
  Install tree (sudo yum install tree) 
  
  soruce code (app.java) - develoeprs will write the code here
  test fodler (apptest.java) - it will write test cases.
  
  open Vi pom.xml
  groupid
  artifactid
  packaging -jar (need to jar files created)
  
  
  Scope
  ======
  Compile : it will need run time 
  Provided 
  runtime - for calling only in runtime (dependencies) - No need put compile time
  test : test face only we can use
  system : Manadatory pass absoulte path 
  import : for denedencies management used impport. BOM
  
  Suppose project have lot of file. we can't sit all porject compiles right.
  For these we use maven . it 's automatically do compile and test .
  
  $mvn  package -it will scan and download jar files from maven central repository.
  Ocne package installed it will automatically created target . inside target our jar files created.
