wget -- download the software
    1) need to external software . then we can use wget and download the software after tar and untar.
    2) already softwares in yum repository. yum install java or dotnet.

nohup : nohangup 

        if u give command , not getting hang.run the background process.

kill -3 : threaded up . troubleshoot time used.

 SDLC : Software development life cycle
 
 plan->design->build->test->deployment->release->monitoring

 plan : gather requirement
 defining : what languages we are using .
 Design : start development (devops start)
        
           if u want start development where we need to write code and where maintined
   old days : they can write code in local system and keep in shared folders . for the reason sometimes delay or getting issue.

   now days : version control system (VCS):
               VCS ntg but it will keep one track the all changes .
             1) centraliazed version control system (sub version )
                 center server- where u need to write code ,once code written u can keep maintain in server.
                  that is called commit.
    incase CVCS server getting traced , we may loss the data. for the reason we use.

             2)Distributed version control system (DVCS) - > Ex: git 
      Here every developer will get one copy of ur repository (centralized location of the server or where ur maintaning the code)
        repository (folder) -> where code exists.

Git : git is distributed versio control system to manage ur source code. this is ntg but source code management tool.
     
    --> How maintain the source code : source code manegement will maintain the code.

    --> go to root user the check

    --> first check install git 

          git --version (here showing installed or not) 

    --> install git :
                      yum install git
                      git version 2.47.1

    --> yum update (sometimes we can use always . for suppose is ther any updates automatically updated)

    --> create repsository : 
        -------------------- 
           git init reposirotyname 

            Ex:  git init git_repo

             #)how to find repository or directory
               ls -lrta
                 .git -->directory name with end 

      --> now need to work in Repository.
          first create file in repostiroy with some data.
         once created file , u have add file in staging area.

         $ git add : 
                     Moves changes from the working directory to the staging area.

         $ give status 

         $ git add filename 

    ---> once add file in repository , then we can commit.

         $ git commit -m  "mention comments"

       create repository (folder) -->add file in repository-->commit the file 

       Note : Incase sometimes need to modified the file , then again need to add file in staging area and do again commit.

              Once again added the file , after u realized those changes don't want .. for that time we can use command
             
          $ git restore --staged filename 

          $ git checkout filename 

          $ git log (track the entire commit status and id displayed)

       Note : For suppose once commited the file , but after need to revert the file . we need to use command

          $ git revert --(before u have to take commit id : git log --oneline) 

          $ git revert commit id (delete revert line and give comments why revert)
   
    ---> For suppose know the commit id , but inside commit id what happend or who did) 

          $ git show commitid  (showing all changes lines or added)



    Git 2nd class 
    ==============

        For suppose ur working middle of the file ,  but get work from others immediately.
          need to do others work, we can't leave ur file right. we can add file but don't do commit.

         $ git add filename

         $ git status

         Note : first test its working after we can commit. for the reason we can do stash.

         $ git stash
        
            do other work will be finished, add the staging area afetr commit.
             Once others completed , need to go ur work

         $ git stash apply

         after commited , need to changes commit messages then go to 

         $ git commit --amend
